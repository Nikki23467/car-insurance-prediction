ðŸš— Car Insurance Purchase Prediction
This project predicts whether a customer will purchase car insurance using machine learning modelsâ€”Logistic Regression and XGBoostâ€”deployed via a Streamlit web app.
This project, Car Insurance Purchase Prediction, is a machine learning web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to purchase car insurance based on their demographic and behavioral data. It uses two classification modelsâ€”Logistic Regression and XGBoost (Boosted Decision Tree)â€”trained on a dataset containing features like age, gender, vehicle damage, annual premium, and more. The web interface is built using Streamlit, allowing users to upload a .csv file and receive predictions instantly from both models. The project is implemented using Python 3.13, with tools such as Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, pandas, scikit-learn, and xgboost. The trained models are saved using joblib and integrated into the app for fast inference. This project is designed for educational and research purposes and is available to try via the live Streamlit app.
